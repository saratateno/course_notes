### Raising from Investors - 10 biggest mistakes
Monique Maley
mmaley@
Articulate Persuasion
* Fund raising is a full time job

#1. Story
* Typically people spend 75% on product only 25% on company. Investor is BUYING THE COMPANY, THE BUSINESS - not the product.

Should spend time: 25% Product, 75% Company
* What problem are you solving and why is this solution so much better? Then shut up on product!
* Focus on how are you going to make money?

--> The Why: Should be about the future, the moving train. Less important is story on how you got there (except for how you experienced the problem and got the domain knowledge.)

#2. Edit
* PURPOSE OF PITCH: Is to win more time!
* They don't need to know everything - they just need to want to find out more.. The breadcrumbs & morsels.
* Take every bit of 'data' you have and put each piece on a post-it
* Storyboard the film - what's important? Does it tell the story? Move the data about.. some goes on the back up slides for answering questions, not the main bit of your pitch.
* "If i had more time, I would have written a shorter letter"

#3. Language of Conviction
* Your positive script - check your language. NOT 'We're hoping', 'We're thinking'...
* Better "This is where we're going", "This is what's happening"
* You need to sound like you have the conviction - their conviction can only be strong as yours.

#4. Deck
* DON'T PowerPoint. Slides are your BACKUP. Context, depth. YOU are the pitch.
* Get story straight first - THEN only put in the slides that reinforce what you said. Min size text font - 30px!
* Less time spent listening to you if they are reading the slides. Attention should be on YOU.
* Quick, get it and then listen to what you're saying. Ugly detail slides go in the backup.
* ALWAYS work with a graphic designer and clarify your thoughts by talking to them and getting them to translate your thoughts into visuals for the slides. Your story is not right if they can't get the slides right.

#5. Prep for Q&A
* Don't tank on Q&A! Leave time for it, prep for it just as much.
* Their first q's are going to be the things you edited out. You know what they are. Formulate tight, concise answers in 2 sentences. Creates energy and shows you are on top of the business.
* ONE person to pitch. Can have CFO etc. in hand for Q&A specific questions, but not to pitch.

#6. Authenticity
* Not about being LIKEABLE, be authentic. Be YOU. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Don't be uncomfortable. Wear what you want to wear.
* They can see if you're not comfortable but they won't know exactly why.
* Present from a place of authenticity

#7. Manage non-verbals
* Body language, tone.
* What messages are you sending?
* Speed of talking, volume, clarity, articulation.

#8. Show passion
* Later stage companies often fail on this
* Create energy in the room, wake up, lean in.
* It's infectious!
* Think back to the moment when you decided to jump into this. What made you do it? That's the thing you need to tap into before you pitch! Exhilaration, excitement and emotion for your company.

#9. Eye contact
* Direct eye contact with everyone in the room; Board Room - talk to the one who's the problem - make the MOST eye contact with the person you're trying to persuade and show you're transparent with them.

#10. Practice OUT LOUD
* Key! It'll catch anything that doesn't sound right or any part that you keep forgetting. Means there is something WRONG - you don't have the conviction on it, or is not clear.
* Comfort with the pitch & learn it.
* Give yourself 24 hours to relax before the pitch. Have a break.

In this order:-

THE STORY,
THE SCRIPT,
THE DECK,
THE DELIVERY.

Length: 11-13 slides about right

RESOURCES
* Sequioa templates; but is e.g. competition relatively more important? Glaring questions need to be addressed early. Readjust to make your story powerful.

### Grumpy Entrepreneur
David Murray-Hundley
@TheGrumpyE
Commerce One

* Cash Flow is key - don't spend your life looking at the business plan and expecting the moment when you're going to raise money.
* Founders - the business might struggle and you get beat up and lose your identity! They don't smile often. Vincent has a clear IDENTITY.
* Don't keep looking back.. especially with tech. Speed of change is phenomenal. Fintech space. Watch out for the Typewriter moment (irrelevancy)
* Even those who look like they ar doing well often can feel things are slipping away..
* Waiting for Eureka moment and burning through cash - NO. Sometimes it's just the wrong timing and it's time to quit.
* Crazy valuations of businesses - everyone is worth £10m at the moment even pre-revenue!

### Russell Buckley Spring Partners
Check him on Medium
Worked on AdMob
Has biggest seedfund in Europe; £50m fund; £500k investment typical
Best way is to get a warm intro
* Your no 1 job as a CEO is Don't run out of money! = fail
* Sell from the start or get investment
* Get good at raising money! Needs skill - people in UK don't know how to do it.
* Get your story right. Pitching needs to be honed & crafted over time. Perfect it.
* You need to want to solve a PROBLEM, not want to start a business.
* Passion for bringing that thing into the world - it will go wrong at some point! Get through the difficulties and make it happen.
* Marketplace and SaaS is 80% of the company's investments; also interested in AdTech, FinTech, Fashion & Retail. Don't want high capital investment startups.
* Invest in getting the right people in to your team - culture is important. An A-team with a good idea is better than a B-team with an amazing idea. They have to be able to execute it.
* Speed of decision-making - CEO's need to be prepared to do it fast and come back to a decision later if necessary. Decision making process can take lots of advice but not be afraid to go a different way from what everyone else is saying.
* Can you persuade great people to believe in your vision and join you? Big idea that will become a big company.
* Legalities for SEIS - networking to find Angel investors
* Social Enterprises can make money... primary purpose of the fund is to make money so this has to be the driver.
* Exponential - what's the plan for growth...

Mustard Seed - Impact investor

### Public Speaking

* Feedback from moving hands --> makes you pay more attention to what's being said.
* Start talks with a quote "People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint" Steve Jobs
* Find your place of Power --> Where you have comfort and can move on in your life, your message. Passion or Vulnerability (intimacy in front of audiences)
* Find your story --> who you are, life journey "Advocate for Truth"
* Technique --> Learn the basics but hone your technique. Watch YouTube for tutorials on delivery, posture, how to stand, talk and articulate -- coach yourself, keep improving

### Influencer networks
Timothy Armoo Fanbytes
* Are people doing anything meaningful with your product? Impressions are bullshit. Engagement is key.
* Make sure you track what MATTERS in your campaign
* The MICRO INFLUENCER is who you need to target
* They are humans - interact with them
* Campaign e.g. - world record lipsynced record
* Logistics & timing - the 3 touch rule --> you need to hit people 3 times before your brand will stick.
* Fear of Missing Out --> People want to be close to the influencer, so consider the content strategy
* Competitions?

### Daniel Lexoo
* Always negotiate a fixed fee --> ask for fixed within reasonable parameters if they say no
* They aren't good at pricing work
* Request multiple quotes and let them KNOW you are getting multiple
* Lawyers must be specialised in your area
* Friends' recommendations are not great...they've prob only used a couple of lawyers before and only for a specific job
* You're paying for overheads and the Lawyer Partner's rate (£1m a year pay!!)
* Senior Associates can leave a firm and charge half but still get paid more!
* Small clients at big firms - you're not a priority. They'll put a junior on your project - poor service, they have to research everything (and get checked by a senior).
* Lexoo only accepts 20% of lawyers applying for the platform - phone interview and get non-editable review after every job
* T&Cs and Privacy Policy are standard, Shareholders agreement, Trademark

### @PhilPallen

What you love combined with something others need -> Satisfy a need then you don't need to spend a lot advertising.

##### Positioning your brand
 * What's your personal brand?
 * Visuals HAVE to look good. People base their first impression on that.
 * Spiritual person --> spiritual photos! Give us an impression of your brand in 3 seconds or less.
 * Photography inspires many parts of the process... then the brand identity. NOT just logo - that is one part of many.
 * You need multiple logo identities - print and on web. Need variations & options.
 * Flexibility to implement your brand.
 * Colour, typography. Check Google fonts are available in print, TypeKit.
 * Icons style - what makes your business unique? Sub-branding. 1 or 2 things about your business that make you unique.
 * Icons for your locations? Icons for your services?
 * How do you communicate your brand to others on your website?
 * The best online branding is when we RECREATE the in-person experience as closely as possible
 * Promote: how to hack and grow your brand --> be awesome on three platforms. Don't go on all of them. What's best for you?
 * Twitter, Pinterest (great examples of branding - 5 mins a day), Snapchat. What should you be updating that platform with?
 * Each platform needs PURPOSE
 * How to maximise Twitter? Bio: most important real estate for you. How people perceive you. 2 sentences. 1 who are you why should I care? 2 Flavour of your personality.
 * Most people are mediocre! You need to be one step closer to being memorable.
 * Keep your old user names; get it on the other platforms and let it sit there as not a priority - keep a presence but focus on where to grow your brand.

 ### Vincent Dignan

 * Vanity + value - time spent = Good Personal Branding

 Personal branding
 * No one cares about you - only see you when you post so just post all the time. Especially Twitter & Instagram
 * Ppl only care about what you can give to or do for them
 * Be everywhere - choose text/video/photos
 * Content is key - good copy is key - make it funny, memorable.
 * The Hook - external trigger, take action, get a reward, invest time and want to go back again - hook pulls you back again. Go because it MIGHT be good. Bit bored / lonely? Go back to Facebook.
 * Use influencers but don't rely on them.. only quirky things that are unique / new can get press. If they don't like you then you are dead.
 * Give influencers affiliates
 * For selling something, you need emails
 * Equation for finding great influencers --> the followers might not be true follows. How much engagement?
 * 10% Content, 90% DISTRIBUTION - how big is your email list, social followers, who will give you a shoutout, FB groups you can drop info into?
 * 1 in 5 good posts is all you need to be remembered - then they'll remember to come back to you.
 * Copy until you develop your own style - try and see what people like.
 * Never turn down public appearances
 * Scale worldwide! When you have you thing, people keep running towards the same things.
 * Be vulnerable - say what people are really feeling... we're a small company that believes... and we're trying to.. personal story..

 * Facebook - people will share personal content and everyone is on there all the time. Where you can get your 1000 true fans first. They'll get to know you.
 * Twitter - public network for people you don't know. Where people will look the first place (Google important)
 * LinkedIN - call to action sentence in your bio
 * A place for content --> test different channels to find them. Get them from as many diff networks as possible and see what works. List out 19 diff channels you're going to generate traffic.
 * Social media - consistent content and frequency.
 * Follow lots of people, reply, pay for shout outs - whatever it is. Get 2,500 followers and THEN have a strategy for likes and shares.
 * Post great links, videos, comments etc.
 * Instagram - find someone who loves what you're doing, follow their followers and see what hashtags they use. Find the smaller hashtags.

 * Shout outs.
 * Tag someone who... (need 2.5k)
 * Re-gramming - ask if you can reshare their content cos you like it.
 * Need to grow your FB network via Groups - find 25-30 groups with over 800 members. Check the admins and see what other groups they are in. 10 a day of good content into those groups.

 * Reddit - can find early adopters and some traffic. Subreddits. Great for finding content for other platforms.
 * Imgur - pics from Reddit
 * ALWAYS WRITE 25 HEADLINES and see which ones work - use bit.ly to track each title. Use a diff title within the tweet for each one, each day. Put it on Facebook on Friday with the title that worked best.
