###### Resources

* howsearchworks
* keyword.io
* Moz toolbar - check authority scale, how established is your site


ACTION
* Complete page meta titles
* Get links!
* Need to create blog of 6-10 posts a month and need to be of a decent length - well researched and thought out to rank well


YOU NEED TO BE ON THE FIRST PAGE OF RESULTS!

People do not click through search results and you need to be in the top 3!

Searches for non-branded topics.

The Customer Journey - Micro moments
* Stimulus (I'm hungry)
* First Moment of Truth (Picking from the Shelf)
* Second Moment of Truth (Having the Experience - then would you go there again?)

* ... Zero Moment of Truth - when you gather info first before the shelf. You write a blog, instagram etc and that becomes someone else's ZMOT

Crawler follows links around the internet and indexes them.

Algorithm looks at your search terms and tries to match from the index. Ranks the results based on >200 factors!

#### Relevance and Importance

* Keywords in copy
* Meta data keywords - meta page title **60-70 chars**, URL, meta description (will use the site if you don't have it) **140-160 characters**
* Use a H1 Header - Google Pays attention to this, h2, h3
* Keywords in to body copy - structure the page so that Google knows what it's about

Choosing keywords
* Google keyword planner - free tool (google how to get to this page now) - do NOT use 'guided tour' when you sign up for Ads. Filter it for LOW competition to begin with - quick wins to create content on that (relatively HIGH volume).
* Keyword.io - free tool
* Google autocomplete - look beyond your personal data to see what's being searched for
* Google searches related to

Put these back in to keyword planner to check volumes and competition level.

** GOOGLE RANKS PAGES NOT SITES **
* ** Choose 1-2 keywords per page and write them with keywords in mind **
* Long tail keywords have higher conversion rates (so Forest Hill Baby Classes vs Baby Classes)

#### Importance
* In-bound links to your site
* Relevancy - need to be a real site
* Authority - quality of that site itself

##### Links
* Directories & citations - needs to be niche specific (e.g. a builders directory), Location specific, General (yell)
* Relationships - suppliers, partners, events, charities
* Content - guest blogging, advice, news, online PR - what do people want to link to?

They use social signals in ranking calculations - Likes and Retweets and +1s contribute

##### Penalties
* Panda: Quality content - not keyword stuffing. Write for the User not for the Search engine!
* Penguin: can't make 100 pages with the same content to flood the internet, link farms etc.

##### Natural & Varied link profile
- Diff types of links
- Number of domains
- Anchor text relevance, 1/3 branded, 1/3 keyword focused
- Landing pages to point throughout your pages, not just your homepage

* Natural use of keywords on pages - over 300 words of content per page or it won't even look at it. For e-commerce you should try to make the descriptions unique to you.

### Content

> Photo - list of types of content

* evergreen content - how tos and guides
* infographics need to be supported with some keywords and alt text - can you make the layout in HTML?? Similarly with videos.

- what do you want the blog to do? Where is the user in the funnel - awareness, interest, consideration, action/ conversion --> different search terms

BEST SENTENCES START WITH..
* WHY
* HOW TO
* ... Not just WHAT

### Google Analytics
* audience - what are they doing on the site
* acq - how are they discovering the site; if organic, where to?
* conversions - set page goals - buy buttons or thank you page etc.
