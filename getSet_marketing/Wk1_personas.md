# MARKETING WEEK 1

## Personas

* Who youre selling to
* Who youre serving

--> Use the most RELEVANT data you can find.

* DEMOGRAPHIC (age, location, etc.)
* PSYCHOGRAPHIC (values, beliefs)
* BEHAVIOURIAL (true past behaviour)
* ENVIRONMENTAL (external influences, culture, tech. Whose referral do they trust?)

Their NEEDS, PAIN POINTS, LANGUAGE for messaging. Create the right product or service for their need.

TARGETED marketing. Which platforms? Who do they trust?

GENUINE UNDERSTANDING of the thoughts, feelings and behaviours of your customers.

TACTICAL OPPORTUNITIES for your product - pivots, business development

What is NOT a persona?
* Market segment (demog data, market size but NOT behavioural or pyschological data)
* Stereotype (based on presumptions)
* Average customer (you have multiple splits of personas - average doesn't work)
* Role (e.g. 'marketing manager'. Doesn't define goals, aspirations or approaches to problem solving)

Gives you:
* how to message
* which channels
* what's important to them

The important type of people:
* They need to be DECISION MAKERS
* Early Adopters
* Affluent
* You love working with them --> an audience you're happy to serve!

Where to look online?
* BuzzSumo -> type in keyword and see best content / blogs. Which channels have spread those topics? FB vs Twitter
* Amazon reviews!!
* Mumsnet?
* Reddit?
* Google trends - what are they searching for?
* similarweb.com
* askwonder.com - platform for answering more complex questions about your market

FACEBOOK
* Graph Search -> pages liked by people who like oreo (change UK language to US english to access this tool... put your competitors in!)
* Communicate in a similar way to the marketing strategy of the things they like e.g. lego - playful, colourful

TWITTER
* Tweepi & Crowdfire
* Thought leaders and topics they're interested in

PINTEREST - stuff they love
- Cooking, travel, photography, house style, gardening etc.

Time spent and pages viewed --> advertising

Provisional Persona --> based on assumptions!

Age
Gender
