### Social Media Marketing
* Have to have something to distribute
* Pick the ones that make the most sense for your target audience, message, goal

Attitude
* Not a one-way route anymore
* More conversation, less broadcasting
* Tone of voice - different by channel

### Purpose
* exposure
* traffic
* loyal fans

Also..
* market insight
* SEO
* generating leads
* partnerships
* thought leadership
* reducing marketing spend

##### What are you using social media for? GOALS.
* *awareness*
* *branding*
* *building rapport, trust*
* *interactions*
* *advertise*

##### Who are you trying to talk to?

The right platform = where your customers hang out, fit your message, fit your goals

##### Look out for:
* FB Instant Articles - host content (blogs) within FB (not yet being prioritised but prob will be soon - anyone can register for it). Focuses on mobile users - loads faster and easier to reach for mobile.
* Video platform - currently being prioritised.
* Retargeting with FB ads - similar to Google ads. Code on your website allows advertising to people who've already visited you and remind them of your brand.
* Constantly changing platform - keep on top of FB to be  using it efficiently

**YouTube** - 1 bn users. Quite young 25-34. Reach is at expense of TV broadcasters... needs to be high quality content for viewing on TV. Creates new celebrities...! New influencers on a daily basis that people can relate to - moreso than traditional celebs.

** *What do mums want to watch on YouTube?* **

Create a project / programme where people can collaborate and participate.

**Twitter** - ad platform is still not working well for them yet! Tends to be more grads, more 18-29 engaging with celebrities etc. Older audience more news, current affairs etc., professions.

Look out for:
* Likes & Moments - trending topics & high quality tweets
* Buy Now button - not being used that much at the moment
* Curated timelines - new.. only showing the more relevant content instead of chronological. Bad for marketers.
* Periscope and Vine - video platforms.

*PokemonGo* - REALLY big!! Marketing platform?

**Instagram** - 400m users! 75m daily. Per-follower engagement rate is 58 times higher than on FB and 120 times higher than on Twitter. **2.5x more likely to click on ads than on other soc media platforms!** But that's because beaufiful images & nicer ads! Easy to target based on interests, hobbies etc.

53% 18-29
25% 30-49

Look out for:
* curated timelines - launched this year. Choose to follow or look for them every time.
* hashtags - people are looking for new people to follow and beautiful images to engage with. People use a lot for hotels and destinations as they are more candid. Good for building communities through hashtags, raise awareness of brand and services. Unique hashtags... Competitions are quite weak, people respond using your hashtag. Create an activity that people will be willing to engage with. Grows your profile through these techniques.
* Boomerang App - 2016. Create short loop videos (gif) movement.
* Silent videos (subtitle), visually expressive. SnapChat filters(?), patterns and repeated themes - a signature for you?
* Popular hashtags: love, instagood, tbt, photooftheday, cute > Try to find ones that are more specific for you but things that are already being used out there (join a community), or v specific ones where you'll be accidentally found

**Pinterest** 67m mostly female, beautiful things - fashion, design, food, fitness. Higher education and income.

Look out for:
* Buyable pins - selling physical products for small businesses.
* Community boards - can invite people to contribute to your board.
* Geometric tiles, mermaid hair colours, teaching kids to code, futuristic consumer (fun) tech, travel

**LinkedIn** does it make sense? Content focused in future. B2B, job hunters etc. Mostly urban, grads, all ages, higher income. > Maybe more about building network as an entrepreneur

Look out for:
* platform articles
* content marketing
* B2B eBooks shared & liked
* Stories about habits (productivity), learning from mistakes, dealing with employees, being a good leader, keeping jobs and performance etc.
* V targeted ads

**Snapchat** 100m daily users! Higher than Twitter. 7bn video views daily. 24 hour content. Very young audience. 10m UK users. 70% female, low income as young.

* Ghostcode - find snappers to follow and see how its being used
* Snapchat discover - can post longer lasting stories.


## Voice & Topics

* How do you behave?
* What you look like
* What do you talk about

Behaviour:
* tone of voice
* how you write
* how you engage and communicate

So:
* Stay true to your brands value and personality
* Write as you'd speak naturally
* Mild swearwords(!) can convey authenticity (hell, damn etc!)
* Complexity and technicality of language can be increased with length

NB:
* Positive messages tend to be shared much more widely on Facebook
*

Visual Language - how you look
* Imagery, colours, patterns and symbols - a signature thing that makes people realise it's you.
* Consistency in language and topics - integrity.
* e.g. Taco Bell used valencia filter on all photos and same colours all the time - sense of security and safety.
* e.g. Wolf & Moon - E London hipster vibe with a twist.

Your Topic
* what are you known for? Consistency attracts people and knowing what to expect from you increases follower numbers.
* e.g. area of expertise, an area you are committed to, passions - what you're writing about and giving talks on, e.g. will it blend?

What about your own personal skills? You are your own Soc Media manager to begin with. What are you good at? Writing, photography, in front of a camera, voice? FORMAT. What suits you best?

## Your Audience

* Which channels are they using?
* Who are they following?
* What do they post about?
* What do they search for?

> Mothers: baby clothes, tips, diets etc.

Look at Pinterest to see what stuff they love. What else do they care about?

## Goals
How to measure ROI? > Check iPhone photo
* Building awareness
* Educating
* Trust

## Info sources: where does it come from?
* original work
* reuse industry news
* trends / thought provoking ideas
* **interviews**
* **best of / round up**

Credibility - academic, expert, tech expert, a person like yourself (bloggers, testimonials, case studies), an employee (not C-suite)!

User Generated Content - needs to be easy, brand needs to be well-loved already and a strong brand. Can you harness creativity within it? e.g. Starbucks decorate a cup. Can you offer them a surprise / prize for it?

## How do you measure ROI?

KNOW YOUR GOAL!
Content and SMM is for BUILDING brands & trust. Not for sales... how do you measure it?

> check iphone photo

* Lead Generation
* Engagement
* Referrals & Advocates -- shares and quaity of engagement from people who'll post about you, for you

Check Google Analytics! Set it up for Goals.

##### Content Marketing ROI

* Consumption Metrics - views, bounce, time spent
* Sharing Metrics - engagement
* Lead Generation - who gave you emails for that content
* Sales - revenue, getting into prospects --> ask people to contact for media pack

## How much TIME to dedicate and when?

* It's networking.. how meaningful?
* Content is king if it meets your client's needs
* Find the fun in it
* Be consistent - don't post frequent rubbish. Put out something valuable.

THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS for Facebook - happy & positive
MONDAYs and after hours for Instagram

Use FB analytics to see when your audience is active.

**PLAN AND SCHEDULE AHEAD!**
* Create monthly content calendars, review it weekly
* Reuse content
* Jump on special days / current events! Hijack news and current events, will more likely be shared.
* Use buffer, hootsuite and laterbro - but have non-scheduled content too

One bigger piece of content periodically - something you can split into smaller chunks. Reuse in different ways - screenshots with little quotes etc.

Shelf life is so short!
Twitter - a few mins
Facebook - 24 hours
Instagram - a bit longer
