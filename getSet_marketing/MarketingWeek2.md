Proud of... time when I've stood by someone and supported them when they needed me. (Ming and her cake!).

You have to embody the values and push it through every part of your business! If you are striving for something that is not yet existing, take care over that.

* Authentic
* Shared - everyone needs to understand them and believe in them
* Held - used as an inner compass
* Lived - used at every decision making step: recruitment, product, development, marketing

What is meaningful?
* What functional value does the product bring? --> the product
* Personal benefits - what is it doing for *me*? The emotional connection / preference. --> cool / beautiful / great UX (this stuff is subjective). Where is the *love*???
* **Collective benefits** - what is it doing for the community / the people I care about? (empowering creative people)

You don't need everyone to love you.

We connect with:
Transparency, connection, causes

You need to stand for something other than making money! > Bleak future, crisis

Use your commitment & values to support a cause that resonates with your audience. Pick a target audience that has similar values to you - not someone you hate!

Identify your competitors and their branding strategy - carve out your own niche.
- companies offering substitute products / services / addressing similar wants and needs. How do they think about their brands?

WHERE IS YOUR NICHE? - See your competitors, their backgrounds and how long in the market, comms, weaknesses. Messaging & positioning. How are they positioning?

> Could we do a prompt "How are we doing?" Annual 'support us' drive a la Wikipedia foundation.

Figure your target audience and really fit in with the things that'll be appealing for them.

Stronger communications when you know exactly who you are talking to.

* Tone of voice
* Audience
* Visual cue to build on
* Passion topic

Brand Positioning -
Functional Values VS Motivational Values

Describes how a brand is different from its copetitors and where it sits in a particular market.

Coca-cola is built entirely on MOTIVATIONAL values - not actually about the functional use to you!

Uber --> functional values entirely; failing on the motivational side of things.

Apple - incorporates both types of values. Something that really works and LOVES. Instils inspirational element.

Check what your competitors are doing on this.. are they saying the same things as you??

USE SHORT VISUAL PERSONAS NOT JUST DEMOGRAPHICS! WHAT DO THEY CARE ABOUT??? WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM? WHAT CAUSES DOES SHE SUPPORT?
